	  tidbit online:
	  
	  "I hadn’t considered what I was doing with this code. When
	  comparing two objects
	  using the non-strict comparison operator (==) PHP compares all
	  the properties
	  of the objects and if they match the objects are deemed to be
	  equal. If they
	  don’t match they are not equal. In effect, we have a recursive
	  comparison of
	  all the properties of each object, and all their properties,
	  etc. until we
	  reach basic data types like strings and integers."

	  A refactoring of Store pages and factories to allow the display
	  of special
	  pages in the case that a page is not visible. This gives the
	  user better
	  feedback when they switch locales on the website. If the page is
	  not available
	  in a given region, but is available in another, a friendly
	  message lets them
	  know and provides links to the region with the
	  article/category/product.

	  The ticket states: "Remove All buttons are a bit weird/redundant
	  when you only
	  have 1 item in your cart (or even when you only have 2 or 3)."
	  I've removed the
	  buttons when there's one item in any of the saved, unavailable,
	  or available
	  carts, but it's a simple to change to hide it in the case where
	  there are more

	  on-demand later.
	  - Update category, product, and search pages to efficiently load

	  pages, just an extra join.
	  - Remove image loading from cart module since images are not
	  displayed on the cart.

	  Major refactoring of the site framework across all packages.
	  This is still a bit rough, but both the Veseys frontend and the
	  admin are running on it. While the Admin package was changed
	  heavily to work with the new Site package, its interface did not
	  change much so admin site code requires minimal changes to work.
	  
	  - Go upstream! Site package does more now.
	  - Remove duplicated functionality form Store and Admin packages.
	  - SiteLayout and subclasses are now responsible for the "site
	  trim".

	  too.
	  - Single point of page sub-classing from StorePage to VeseysPage
	  is gone allowing other base page subclasses in Store.
	  - The *Internal() methods are gone from Store,
	  init()/proccess()/build() are now sub-classed directly.
